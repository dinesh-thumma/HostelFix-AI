We tried to operate the RO plant so that we can have some drinking water in our Dispenser but the water level is too low even after this much of water pumping. 
I urge each one of you to conserve water so basic needs first.

"20/09/24, 1:41 pm - +91 98217 87834: ‼️My cycle tyre had been losing air within just 2 days of filling them. So I went to the cycle shop in front of mega mess 1 and told him that i needed to fix a puncture in my tyre. He told me to come back in 1 hr. After picking up my cycle whose puncture was fixed, the tyre began losing air within an hour. When I went back there to ask about it, he opened up the tyre and showed me a hole on the tube, near the pin for the tube and told me that it can't be fixed and needed a replacement. When I asked why had he claimed earlier that it was fixed, the guy didn't give an answer and was very evasive. I checked the tube and it didn't have any new repair work done. "
I am asking if anyone has had the same experience.If not then i advise that anyone going for a tyre puncture be present while they are working on your cycle as it is profitable for them to replace a part than fix it.
"20/09/24, 2:16 pm - +91 85974 73807: Yes I faced the same issue a week back."
SCIEnT is launching a Cycle Number Plate Drive to help *reduce cycle thefts* and aid in *recovering lost cycles in our campus*. Custom metal number plates will be securely attached to cycles for added security and potential future use to take cycles off-campus. We request all students to fill out the survey form below to take forward this initiative and improve cycle safety on campus.
The Wi-Fi on the east wing of the second floor is not working properly.

"20/01/25, 9:49 pm - +91 94890 66248: Water pressure is too low because of some water pipe line broken on Thiruverumbur area. That is told by water supply team so that is the reason for this issues."
"20/01/25, 10:06 pm - +91 88734 63926: Drinking water quality is not good."
It's been a long time we're facing this issue...
I have talked to Shivkumar (Hostel Manager) regarding the water  shortage and quality issue.
"He told there is no shortage going on, only sometime pressure might be slow."
"Regarding water Quality, He confirmed to talk to some people to go and inspect the water quality, But you both @⁨AJE KARMELRAJ⁩ and @⁨Ajay Prajapat (Simon Sir Scholar)⁩ kindly get signature from students when the people come for testing the water quality and at the same time inform to students also those who are claiming that they have issues with water quality"
Whatever this pressure issue is…east side wing is badly affected with that…it is been one week…students are asking how with same pressure west side tanks are getting filled full and not east side.
"21/01/25, 1:52 pm - +91 99625 50977: Same here sir , been suffering from cold and throat ache for the past one week , we have to go to other Hostels to get good water which is our basic needs ....if other hostels don't have any issues then what seems to be problem with our hostel alone ...kindly look into this sir .."
"21/01/25, 1:57 pm - +91 99037 48147: 2nd floor East wing water cooler also no water"
RO Plant is also not working for east side.
Once East side  RO Plant starts working then this water quality issue will automatically get solved.
"21/01/25, 2:44 pm - +91 94951 11941: I am in class sir, if someone is there in the hostel, please go and meet them and convey this problem."
"21/01/25, 6:01 pm - Hostel Warden Amethyst NIT TRICHY: Some machinery needs repair, hostel office have informed to CPWD authorities."
Once they repair then only we will be able to start the water from that Dispenser
"21/01/25, 6:13 pm - +91 91096 22095: Sir next time please come when the residents are actually in hostel so rather than just listening they actually gets to talk to you and convey their issues"
"22/01/25, 8:15 am - +91 72592 79457: Sir hot water is not available in the cold mornings"
"Yesterday the electrition came and solved electrical issues at room no 12,167,114,97,62 and some things wants to be replaced."
"24/01/25, 7:26 pm - +91 94058 93573: Sir, room no 181 tubelight needs to be replaced but electrician didn't visit yesterday...."

Please do the needful.
"24/01/25, 9:48 pm - Ravikanth Mech. NIT TRICHY: Room no. 136, window curtain holder need to be fixed"
"24/01/25, 10:43 pm - +91 96559 47152: The electrition told that the switch is problem that should be replaced"
"this problem was identified by the same person 1 month ago, "
"From my understanding as an engineer and the same was conveyed to electrician, there is some issues related to room earthing, due to neutral cut somewhere in line or at the devices. Just to hide the problem electrician had removed the room earthing from the LDB, which implies there is no earthing in the room and neutral line is charged. Which has a high hazard potential to our sensitive electronic equipments like laptop, tablets or mobile phones or even class C fire hazard. "
Pls see to this problem on a urgent basis to prevent any emergency.

"01/02/25, 5:07 pm - +91 96452 88173: Also could you please explain why the water supply is an issue in this hostel specifically, while it remains uninterrupted in the other hostels ?"
There is no shortage of water.
"01/02/25, 5:16 pm - +91 72592 79457: Yes, water is restored - good to know. But the real question remains unanswered, who closes the inlet in the first place? and why is this issue exclusive to our hostel?"
No such shortage is there in hostel.
"01/02/25, 5:18 pm - +91 96452 88173: Also, why are you interrupting the messages? We are not trying to criticize the college or the hostel; we are simply stating the facts. When we needed water for certain purposes, it was unavailable."
"01/02/25, 5:21 pm - +91 96452 88173: Understood. If there is no water available in the toilet next time, I'll contact you. Is that acceptable, so that the hostel inmates don't panic?"
"01/02/25, 5:26 pm - +91 79945 06238: I think more panic is created when there is no water. Not while reading the message."
"01/02/25, 5:29 pm - +91 72592 79457: Interesting theory. But the fact remains - water was unavailable in the ground floor west side toilets until it was pointed out, and now it's back. If it's not an inlet issue, then what caused the selective shortage? Would love to hear an explanation that actually addresses this before you sideline the real issue again."
No need for you to contact me or someone…I will be first one to inform this to authorities….if water is not there in hostel then warden sir and hostel office will take appropriate measures as usual.
