# HostelFix-AI
This is an NLP project that deals with user's complaints. It takes the complaint text from a user (student) and based on the contents and context of the complaint it determines the priority of the complaint, whether the fix needs the help of a skilled repair person (eg: Electician...) and whether the fix needs a spare part replacement.
